###This document began as a paired partner assignment with Nurbek Ismailov. This is why much of this site is about him.
###Added CSS independently.
###Utilized className to change correct and incorrect answers in the DOM.

*element.innerHTML and element.src
 *Learned how to use both of these in javascript
 *Used console to discover that I can't user innerHTML with an <img> tag because it will place another img tag at the end of the tag I created.
 *Instead, I can use element.src = "path_to_image"
 *Of course, I can also change the <img> to  <p>

 ##Updating game function:
 Putting a fourth parameter (image) enables the above element.src command to work when someone gets a question correct.
